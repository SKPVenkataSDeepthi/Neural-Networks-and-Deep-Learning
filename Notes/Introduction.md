# Introduction

* Deep learning enables the computer to build complex concepts out of simpler concepts

  
* Deep learning, a type of artificial intelligence, has been around for a long time, but people have called it by different names over the years depending on their views and ideas. Sometimes it was very popular, and at other times, people lost interest in it. As we've gathered more data over the years, deep learning has become more useful and effective. The models used in deep learning have also gotten bigger and better as our computers and technology have improved, making it possible to handle more complex tasks. Over time, deep learning has been able to tackle harder problems and has become more accurate in solving them.


## Three Waves of Neural Networks:
The field of neural networks has gone through three main phases, or "waves."
1. The first wave started in the 1940s-1960s, focusing on early brain-inspired models like the perceptron. These models were the first attempts to teach machines to "learn" in a very basic way, inspired by how the brain might process information.
2. The second wave began in the 1980s, using more advanced techniques to train neural networks with one or two hidden layers, a big improvement from the earlier models.
3. The third wave, which we are currently in, started around 2006 and focuses on deep learning. This involves using much larger, more complex neural networks with many layers, allowing machines to learn from huge amounts of data and solve more complex problems.

## Why is it called Neural Networks?
Early on, researchers were trying to model artificial intelligence based on how the brain works. The idea was that if we understand how the brain produces intelligent behavior, we could copy it with machines. That's why it was called "neural networks," as these models mimic, in a simplified way, the structure of brain neurons.
But over time, scientists realized that the models they were developing weren’t very accurate representations of how real brains work. Now, neural networks are more of an engineering tool rather than a biological one.

* Fast forward to 2006, and there was a big breakthrough. A researcher named Geoffrey Hinton found a clever way to train very deep networks (called deep belief networks) that could learn layer by layer. This led to the rise of "deep learning," which has become incredibly popular and powerful, allowing computers to perform better than older AI methods in many areas.

## Why has deep learning become popular in recent times?
* Think of it this way: imagine you’re teaching a child to recognize objects. The more examples you show them, like different types of cars or animals, the better they get at recognizing new ones. The same goes for computers—when you give them more data, they learn better and faster. And the deep learning methods we use today are pretty similar to the ones from decades ago, but the difference now is that we can give these algorithms way more data, which is a huge help.

* In the past, people worked with small amounts of data, maybe a few hundred or thousand examples, because gathering and organizing data was difficult and computers were slower. But as technology advanced and more of our lives moved online, it became easier to collect massive amounts of data. Nowadays, every time you interact with a computer, whether browsing the internet, using an app, or even taking photos, that information can be stored as data. This is what we call the era of "Big Data."

* In the 1990s, datasets with tens of thousands of examples were considered large, like the MNIST dataset, which contains scans of handwritten numbers from 0 to 9. By the 2000s, datasets started getting more sophisticated and even larger, with millions of examples, like images of objects, house numbers, or even translations between languages.

* Because of this explosion of data, teaching computers to recognize patterns or make decisions has become much easier. For example, researchers have found that if you can give a deep learning system at least 5,000 examples of something (like a type of animal or car), it can start to perform pretty well. And if you give it around 10 million examples, it can get as good as or even better than a human at recognizing things.

* Now, there’s still a challenge when we don’t have that much labeled data (data where we already know the correct answer), so researchers are exploring ways to use large amounts of data that hasn’t been labeled to keep improving the learning process.

## Real-Worls Impact
* In 2012, deep learning achieved a breakthrough when it won a major competition called ImageNet, where AI systems are tested to see how well they can recognize objects in photos. The winning AI system dramatically reduced the error rate in recognizing objects, and deep learning models have been winning this contest ever since, getting better each year.

* Deep learning has also revolutionized other areas. In speech recognition, which powers things like voice assistants (e.g., Siri or Alexa), error rates were stuck for years, but deep learning suddenly made the technology much better, cutting errors in half. It also led to amazing results in detecting pedestrians for self-driving cars, recognizing road signs, and even performing tasks better than humans in some areas.

* As these models grew larger and more advanced, they were able to tackle increasingly complex problems. For example, early deep learning systems could identify one object in an image, but newer models can recognize entire sequences, like reading text from an image or translating languages. Some advanced models can even "program themselves" to solve tasks by learning from examples.

* One of the most impressive applications of deep learning has been in reinforcement learning, where an AI system learns by trial and error without human guidance. A major achievement in this area was when the company DeepMind trained a deep learning system to play Atari video games at a human-level. These models are now being used in robotics to improve how robots learn tasks.

* Deep learning is not only useful in technology companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook, but it is also making a huge impact in scientific research. It helps pharmaceutical companies design new drugs, assists physicists in searching for subatomic particles, and even helps neuroscientists study the human brain by analyzing images.

* The rapid advances in deep learning have been possible thanks to faster computers, larger datasets, and better software. Various tools, like TensorFlow and PyTorch, have made it easier for researchers and companies to develop deep learning applications.

* In summary, deep learning has become extremely powerful, expanding into many areas of our lives—from technology to science. And while it’s already achieved a lot, there’s still a lot of potential for even more breakthroughs in the future.
