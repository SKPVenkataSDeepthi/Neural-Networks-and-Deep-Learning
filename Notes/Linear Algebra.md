1. Scalars: Think of a scalar as a single building block, like a number you might use to count or measure. For example, “5” could represent 5 apples or 5 dollars. It’s just a plain number, with no direction or extra dimensions. Scalars are the simplest type of data: just one single value.
---

2. Vectors: Now, let’s take several of these building blocks and line them up in a row. This line of numbers is called a vector. For instance, imagine a list that describes a point in space, like (2, 3). Here, "2" could represent a distance on the x-axis, and "3" on the y-axis. Together, they show not only a value but also a specific direction or position. Vectors can represent things like speed and direction in everyday life, or even features about something (like age, weight, height).
---

3. Matrix: If a vector is one line of numbers, a matrix is like having a grid or table of them, with rows and columns. Think of a table where you have rows for different people and columns for their characteristics—like name, age, and height. Each row represents one person, and each column a specific piece of information. A matrix holds lots of data points at once and can help us see relationships across different groups.
---

4. Tensors: Now, if you keep adding layers to this idea, you end up with something called a tensor. A tensor is like a stack of matrices that allows you to represent data with even more complex relationships. Think of it like a cube of numbers that you can slice into matrices or vectors, and each slice could represent a different "dimension" of information. For instance, if you’re looking at images as data, each pixel's color might have a tensor that includes color channels (red, green, blue) and brightness.
---

5. Matrix Transpose: When you transpose a matrix, you essentially flip it over its diagonal. So, every row becomes a column, and every column becomes a row.
Before Transpose:
1 2
3 4
After Transpose:
1 3
2 4
---

6. Matrix Dot Product: The dot product is when you combine two matrices to get a new single matrix. This process is like merging numbers in a special way.
Matrix A:
1 2
3 4
Matrix B:
5 6
7 8
A Dot B(top-left position):
(1 * 5) + (2 * 7) = 5 + 14 = 19
---

7. Identity Matrix:
* Think of an identity matrix as a special kind of grid or table of numbers, much like a bingo card. Imagine a square grid where every spot on the diagonal, running from the top left to the bottom right, has a "1" in it, and all the other spots have a "0."
* The cool thing about this matrix is that when it interacts with other matrices (think of it like multiplying it with another number grid), it doesn’t change the other matrix. Just like multiplying a number by 1 doesn’t change the number, multiplying a matrix by an identity matrix keeps the original matrix the same.
Simple Matrix:
2 3
4 5 
Identity Matrix:
1 0
0 1
Multiplying the both we get
2 3
4 5

8. Linear System of Equations:
Suppose we're buying apples and bananas. Apples cost $2 each, and bananas cost $1 each. You have $10 to spend and want to buy a total of 7 fruits. We can set up a system of equations to represent this situation:
Let:
  x = number of apples
  y = number of bananas
Equations:
1) 2x + y = 10        # total cost equation
2) x + y = 7          # total number of fruits
This can have
1. No solution
2. Many solutions and
3. Exctly one solutions means multiplication by the matrix is an invertible function.
---

9. Matrix Inversions:
* Matrix inversion is like a "reverse" button for a matrix. If a matrix transforms an input into an output, the inverse matrix undoes that transformation, returning the output back to the original input. Not all matrices have inverses, but when they do, the inverse allows us to reverse the process.
---

10. Invertability
* In simple terms, invertibility of a matrix refers to whether a matrix can be "reversed" or "undone" like how division works with numbers. Just as dividing by zero is impossible, some matrices can't be reversed either.
1. More rows than columns (Matrix can't be inverted)
| 1  2 |
| 3  4 |
| 5  6 |
This matrix has 3 rows and 2 columns. Here the rows are more than the columns, This means there are more equations than the variables to solve them, making it impossible to find a unique solution for every row. It’s like having three tasks to do but only two tools to work with—some tasks won’t be able to be solved because there aren’t enough tools.
2. More columns than rows (Matrix can't be inverted)
| 1  2  3 |
| 4  5  6 |
This matrix has 2 rows and 3 columns. Now, there are more columns (3) than rows (2).
This means there are more variables than the equations to define them. It’s like having three unknowns but only two equations to solve them—there’s not enough information to find a unique solution. It's similar to trying to solve for three unknowns but only having two pieces of information. we can't determine a unique answer for each variable.
3. Redundant rows/columns (Linearly dependent, Matrix can't be inverted)
| 1  2 |
| 2  4 |
This matrix has 2 rows and 2 columns. But notice:
The second row is just a multiple of the first row (2 times the first row). This means both rows are not "independent" of each other—they are redundant. we cannot get any new information from the second row because it's simply a repetition of the first row. This is called linear dependence.
* When is a matrix invertible?
For a matrix to be invertible (meaning it can be "reversed"), it needs to:
1. Have an equal number of rows and columns (square matrix).
2. Have no redundant rows or columns (they must be linearly independent).
| 1  2 |
| 3  4 |

11. Norms:
* A norm is a mathematical concept used to measure the "size" or "length" of a vector. You can think of a vector as an arrow pointing from the origin (0, 0, ...) to a specific point in space. The norm tells us how long this arrow is. It’s similar to the idea of measuring the distance from the origin to the point that the vector represents.
* To make it simple:
1. Vector: Imagine an arrow that starts from the origin and points to a specific location in space.
2. Norm: This is a way of measuring how long the arrow is (its size or length).

* There are different ways to calculate the norm, depending on the situation. One of the most common norms is the L2 norm, also called the Euclidean norm, which is the straight-line distance from the origin to the point.
1. The Lp Norm:
* The Lp norm is a more general way of measuring vector size, where p can be any number. The formula for the Lp norm is:
* Formula: ||x||_p = \left( \sum_{i} |x_i|^p \right)^{\frac{1}{p}}
* In simple terms, this formula takes the absolute value of each component of the vector, raises it to the power of p, adds them all up, and then takes the p-th root.

* Key Properties of Norms:
1. Non-Negativity: The norm of a vector is always greater than or equal to 0. The norm is only 0 if the vector is the zero vector (i.e., it has no length).
2. Triangle Inequality: If you add two vectors together, the norm of the sum is always less than or equal to the sum of the norms of the individual vectors. This is like saying the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.
3. Scalar Multiplication: If you multiply a vector by a number (called a scalar), the norm of the new vector is the absolute value of the scalar times the norm of the original vector.

2. The L2 Norm (Euclidean Norm):
* The L2 norm is the most common one and is also known as the Euclidean norm. It’s used to calculate the straight-line distance between the origin and the point represented by the vector, just like how we calculate distance in everyday life (e.g., the distance between two points on a map).
* The L2 norm (Euclidean norm) is given by:
||x||_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{i} x_i^2}
* This is just the familiar Pythagorean theorem that tells you the straight-line distance between two points in 2D space.
* Why Is This Important?
Norms are helpful in many areas of mathematics, physics, and computer science because they give us a way to measure the size, distance, or magnitude of something.
* For example, in machine learning, we use norms to measure how far away a point is from a target or how well a model fits data.
* In summary, norms are ways to measure the "length" or "size" of vectors. The L2 norm is the most common one and measures straight-line distance, but there are other norms like the L1 norm and L∞ norm that measure vector size in different ways.
---

12. Special matrices and vectors
1. Unity Vector (Unit Vector)
* Imagine we have a straight arrow pointing in a specific direction. The unit vector is just an arrow that points in a certain direction but has a fixed length of 1 unit.
* Example: If you have a direction, like North, the unit vector would just show you that direction with a length of 1. If you wanted to move in that direction 3 units, you could simply multiply the unit vector by 3 to get a new arrow that’s 3 units long.

2. Symmetric Matrix
* A symmetric matrix is a square table (or grid) of numbers where the numbers on the left side are mirrored on the right side, and the numbers above the diagonal are the same as the numbers below it.
* Think of it like a mirror: Imagine looking at a picture, and if you split the picture down the middle, both halves are identical. A symmetric matrix works the same way; if you flip it across the diagonal (the line from the top left corner to the bottom right), everything on one side matches the other side.
[ 1, 2, 3 ]
[ 2, 4, 5 ]
[ 3, 5, 6 ]


3. Orthogonal Matrix
* An orthogonal matrix is like a perfectly arranged group of people standing in rows and columns, where every row and column is at a right angle (90 degrees) to the others.
* In simple terms, an orthogonal matrix represents a transformation that does not stretch or shrink the space, just rotates it. The rows and columns are so well aligned that they are independent of each other and don't overlap.
* Example: Think of a grid of points, and now rotate it. The grid’s structure stays the same, but the points have just moved around, and the distance between them remains unchanged. That’s what an orthogonal matrix does — it keeps distances the same while rotating.
---

13. Eigen Decomposition
1. Understanding the Basics of Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Imagine you have a grid or a piece of fabric that can stretch in different directions. Now, let’s say there are some specific directions along which, when you pull or stretch the fabric, it stretches straight in that direction without bending or changing direction. These special directions are like the eigenvectors of that fabric.
* The eigenvalue tells you how much the fabric stretches along that specific direction. If an eigenvalue is 1, the fabric doesn’t change size along that direction, but if it’s 2, it doubles in size in that direction, and if it’s 0.5, it shrinks to half its original size.
* In mathematical terms:Eigenvector is the direction that remains consistent. Eigenvalue is the scaling factor (stretch or shrink) in that direction.

2. What is Eigen Decomposition?
Now, eigen decomposition is a way to break down or decompose a square matrix into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. When we decompose a matrix, we find these special directions (eigenvectors) and the stretch factors (eigenvalues).

3. Why Eigen Decomposition?
Eigen decomposition is useful because it simplifies understanding the transformations that a matrix can perform. Instead of looking at a matrix as a whole, we can understand it through its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

4. Special Properties of Real Symmetric Matrices
If a matrix is symmetric (meaning it’s identical across a diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right), it has a nice property: its eigenvalues are real numbers (not complex numbers), and its eigenvectors are orthogonal (meaning they’re at right angles to each other). This makes these matrices especially easy to work with in applications.

5. How to Perform Eigen Decomposition
For a matrix \( A \), we can perform eigen decomposition by following these steps:
1. Finding the Eigenvectors \( v \): These vectors indicate the directions in which the matrix stretches or compresses.
2. Finding the Eigenvalues \( \lambda \): These values show how much each eigenvector's direction is scaled (stretched or compressed).
* The matrix \( A \) can be represented as:
\[
A = V \, \text{diag}(\lambda) \, V^{-1}
\]
where:
- \( V \) is a matrix with each column as one of the eigenvectors.
- \( \text{diag}(\lambda) \) is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues on its diagonal.
- \( V^{-1} \) is the inverse of \( V \).
* This formula helps us "decompose" the matrix into directions and scaling factors, which can simplify complex transformations and analyses.
* Example in Simple Terms
Imagine a round balloon. When we inflate it, it expands evenly in all directions. But if we squeeze it, it might stretch more in one direction than the other—this stretched direction is like the eigenvector, and the amount it stretches is like the eigenvalue.
So, eigen decomposition allows us to understand and control the way we’re transforming space, data, or any structure represented by a matrix in a more meaningful way.

14. Singular value decomposition
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a method in linear algebra used to break down a complex matrix (a grid of numbers, if you will) into simpler parts, which helps in understanding the underlying patterns or "directions" in data. It’s widely used in data science, machine learning, and statistics to analyze data and solve complex mathematical problems, especially when exact solutions are hard to find or when the data is incomplete.
* To break down SVD:
Think of a Matrix as a Transformation: Imagine a matrix as a tool that can stretch, rotate, or flip a space of data points. The SVD helps us understand how this transformation works by breaking it into three simpler pieces.
* Three Key Components:
1. U: This represents the direction in the original data space.
2. Σ (Sigma): This is a diagonal matrix that tells us how much each direction stretches or compresses the data.
3. V: This represents the direction in the transformed space.
When we apply these components together (U * Σ * V^T), they recreate the original matrix.
* Uses of SVD:
1. SVD can be used for data compression and noise reduction, like filtering out noise in images.
2. It's also helpful for finding patterns in data, such as identifying the main topics in a set of documents.

15. Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse
When we want to "reverse" a matrix, the inverse helps us go back to the original form. However, not all matrices have a clean inverse, especially when they are not square (having the same number of rows and columns) or when they represent equations that are hard to solve precisely.
* The Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse is a clever way to "pseudo-reverse" any matrix to find the best possible solution to a system of equations. Here’s how it works:
1. One Solution (Exact Solution):
If there’s a perfect match or exact solution, the pseudoinverse acts just like the regular inverse, finding that solution directly.
2. No Solution (Inconsistent Equations):
If the system doesn’t have an exact solution (like trying to fit a line through a set of points that don’t quite line up), the pseudoinverse finds the solution with the smallest possible error. Think of this as the best compromise.
3. Many Solutions:
If there are many ways to solve the equation, the pseudoinverse finds the solution that has the smallest norm. This means it looks for the simplest or "smallest" solution that still works, in terms of the size of the solution vector.

* The Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse is used to "pseudo-reverse" a matrix, especially when an exact inverse doesn't exist. The pseudoinverse, denoted as \( A^+ \), is calculated from the SVD of **A** as follows:

If \( A = U \Sigma V^T \), then:

\[
A^+ = V \Sigma^+ U^T
\]

where \( \Sigma^+ \) is derived by:
1. Taking the reciprocal of each non-zero value in \( \Sigma \).
2. Transposing the resulting matrix.

---

16. Situations for the Pseudoinverse

The pseudoinverse provides solutions in different scenarios:

1. Exactly one solution: \( A^+ \) acts like the inverse.
2. No solution: \( A^+ \) gives the solution with the smallest error.
3. Many solutions: \( A^+ \) provides the solution with the smallest norm.
This makes the Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse a powerful tool in solving systems of linear equations, especially in cases of overdetermined (more equations than variables) or underdetermined (more variables than equations) systems.

* When **A** has:
- More columns than rows (underdetermined system): The pseudoinverse provides one of the many possible solutions with the minimum norm.
- More rows than columns (overdetermined system): The pseudoinverse gives the solution with the minimum error in terms of Euclidean norm.
---

17. Trace
The trace of this matrix is the sum of the numbers that sit along the main diagonal of the grid.
[ 3  2  1 ]
[ 0  4  5 ]
[ 6  7  9 ]
* Identify the Diagonal: The main diagonal of a matrix is the line of numbers that goes from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. In the matrix above, these numbers are 3, 4, and 9.
* Add the Diagonal: To find the trace, just add up these diagonal numbers
